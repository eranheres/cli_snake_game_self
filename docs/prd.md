## Requirement Analysis

The product needs to be a CLI snake game based on pygame. It should have a simple user interface, fast response times, score keeping, and increasing difficulty. The user should be able to easily start a new game and quit at any time.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Create a simple, user-friendly CLI snake game']
- ['P0', 'Ensure the game runs smoothly with no lag']
- ['P1', 'Incorporate basic features of a snake game like score keeping and increasing difficulty']
- ['P1', 'Allow the user to easily start a new game']
- ['P1', 'Allow the user to quit the game at any time']

## UI Design draft

The game will be displayed in the command line interface. It will have a simple layout with the game grid in the center, the score displayed at the top, and the controls displayed at the bottom. The snake and food will be represented by different characters.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific controls for the game are not specified in the original requirements. For simplicity, we will use the arrow keys for movement and 'q' to quit the game.
