## Implementation approach

We will use the pygame library to create the game interface and handle user input. The game logic will be implemented in a Game class, which will manage the game state and update the display. We will also use a Snake class to represent the snake and a Food class to represent the food. The game will run in a loop until the user quits or the snake collides with itself. We will use the time module to control the game speed and increase the difficulty as the game progresses.

## Data structures and interface definitions

        class Game{
            +int score
            +bool game_over
            +start_game()
            +end_game()
            +update_display()
        }
        class Snake{
            +list body
            +str direction
            +move()
            +grow()
            +check_collision()
        }
        class Food{
            +tuple position
            +generate()
        }
        Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls
        Game "1" -- "1" Food: controls
    

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant M as Main
        participant G as Game
        participant S as Snake
        participant F as Food
        M->>G: start_game()
        loop game loop
            G->>S: move()
            G->>S: check_collision()
            G->>F: generate()
            G->>G: update_display()
        end
        G->>M: end_game()
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
